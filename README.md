Celestial Bodies Database

This repository contains a dump file of a database created during the Relational Database course on freeCodeCamp. The project was focused on building a Celestial Bodies Database.
Overview

The project aims to create a relational database to store information about various celestial bodies, including galaxies, stars, planets, moons, and related attributes. The database schema includes tables with relevant details about these objects, such as their names, sizes, and relationships with other entities (e.g., stars, galaxies, planets).
Features

    Galaxies: Information about different galaxies, including their name, age, and type.
    Stars: Data about stars, including their age, type, and the galaxy they belong to.
    Planets: Details about planets, such as distance from Earth, whether they have life, and if they are spherical.
    Moons: Information about moons and their associated planets.

Project Structure

This repository includes:

    A dump file of the database.
    SQL queries for creating the database schema.
    Data inserted into the tables as part of the project requirements.

How to Use

    Import the dump file into your preferred database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
    Explore the data and run queries to analyze and manipulate the celestial bodies data.
